Using Subqueries to Solve Queries

1. Subquery Syntax
   SELECT select_list
   FROM   table
   WHERE  expr operator
               (SELECT select_list
                FROM   table);
   -- The subquery (inner query) executes before the main query (outer query).
   -- You can place the subquery in a number of SQL clauses, including the 
      following:
      - WHERE clause
      - HAVING clause
      - FROM clause
   -- In the syntax:
         operator includes a comparison condition such as >, =, or IN
      - Comparison conditions fall into two classes:
          single-row operators, >, =, >=, <, <=, <>
          multiple-row operators ( IN ANY, ALL, EXISTS )

2. Using a Subquery
   Examples:
      SELECT last_name, salary
      FROM   employees
      WHERE  salary > 
                      (SELECT salary
                       FROM   employees
                       WHERE  last_name = 'Abel');

3. Guidelines for Using Subqueries
   -- A subquery must be enclosed in parentheses.
   -- Place the subquery on the right side of the comparison condition for 
      readability.
   -- Use single-row operators with single-row subqueries and multiple-row 
      operators with multiple-row subqueries.

4. Types of Subqueries
   -- Single-row subqueries
      Queries that return only one row from the inner SELECT statement
   -- Multiple-row subqueries
      Queries that return more than one row from the inner SELECT statement
   -- Multiple-column subqueries
      Queries that return more than one column from the inner SELECT statement.

5. Single-row subqueries
   5.1. Single-row Subqueries
        Examples:
           Displays the employee whose job ID is the same as that of employee 
           141.
           SELECT last_name, job_id
           FROM   employees
           WHERE  job_id = 
                           (SELECT job_id
                            FROM   employees
                            WHERE  employee_id = 141);
