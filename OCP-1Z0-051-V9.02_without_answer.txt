1. View the Exhibit and examine the structure of the SALES, CUSTOMERS, PRODUCTS,
   and TIMES tables.
   The PROD_ID column is the foreign key in the SALES table, which references 
   the PRODUCTS table. Similarly, the CUST_ID and TIME_ID columns are also 
   foreign keys in the SALES table referencing the CUSTOMERS and TIMES tables, 
   respectively.
   Evaluate the following CREATE TABLE command:
   CREATE TABLE new_sales(prod_id, cust_id, order_date DEFAULT SYSDATE)
   AS
   SELECT prod_id, cust_id, time_id
   FROM sales;
   Which statement is true regarding the above command?    
                                                                      
   A. The NEW_SALES table would not get created because the DEFAULT value cannot 
      be specified in the column definition.
   B. The NEW_SALES table would get created and all the NOT NULL constraints 
      defined on the specified columns would be passed to the new table. 
   C. The NEW_SALES table would not get created because the column names in the 
      CREATE TABLE command and the SELECT clause do not match. 
   D. The NEW_SALES table would get created and all the FOREIGN KEY constraints 
      defined on the specified columns would be passed to the new table.

2. View the Exhibit to examine the description for the SALES table.
   ┌───────────────────────────────────┐
   │Table SALES                        │
   ├─────────────┬────────┬────────────┤

   Which views can have all DML operations performed on it?
   (Choose all that apply.) 
   A. CREATE VIEW v3
      AS SELECT * FROM SALES   
      WHERE cust_id = 2034   
      WITH CHECK OPTION;
   B. CREATE VIEW v1
      AS SELECT * FROM SALES   
      WHERE time_id <= SYSDATE - 2*365   
      WITH CHECK OPTION;
   C. CREATE VIEW v2
      AS SELECT prod_id, cust_id, time_id FROM SALES   
      WHERE time_id <= SYSDATE - 2*365   
      WITH CHECK OPTION; 
   D. CREATE VIEW v4
      AS SELECT prod_id, cust_id, SUM(quantity_sold) FROM SALES   
      WHERE time_id <= SYSDATE - 2*365   
      GROUP BY prod_id, cust_id   
      WITH CHECK OPTION;

3. You need to extract details of those products in the SALES table where the 
   PROD_ID column contains the string '_D123'.
   Which WHERE clause could  be used in the SELECT statement to get the required 
   output?
   A. WHERE prod_id LIKE '%_D123%' ESCAPE '_'
   B. WHERE prod_id LIKE '%\_D123%' ESCAPE '\'
   C. WHERE prod_id LIKE '%_D123%' ESCAPE '%_'
   D. WHERE prod_id LIKE '%\_D123%' ESCAPE '\_'

4. Which two statements are true regarding single row functions? (Choose two.)
   A. They accept only a single argument.
   B. They can be nested only to two levels.
   C. Arguments can only be column values or constants.
   D. They always return a single result row for every row of a queried table.
   E. They can return a data type value different from the one that is 
      referenced.

5. Which SQL statements would display the value 1890.55 as $1,890.55? 
   ( Choose three .)
   A. SELECT TO_CHAR(1890.55,'$0G000D00')
      FROM DUAL;
   B. SELECT TO_CHAR(1890.55,'$9,999V99')
      FROM DUAL; 
   C. SELECT TO_CHAR(1890.55,'$99,999D99')                         
      FROM DUAL;
   D. SELECT TO_CHAR(1890.55,'$99G999D00')
      FROM DUAL;
   E. SELECT TO_CHAR(1890.55,'$99G999D99')
      FROM DUAL;

6. Examine the structure of the SHIPMENTS table:
   name           Null       Type
   PO_ID          NOT NULL    NUMBER(3)
   PO_DATE        NOT NULL    DATE
   SHIPMENT_DATE  NOT NULL    DATE
   SHIPMENT_MODE              VARCHAR2(30)
   SHIPMENT_COST              NUMBER(8,2)
   
   You want to generate a report that displays the PO_ID and the penalty amount 
   to be paid if the SHIPMENT_DATE is later than one month from the PO_DATE. 
   The penalty is $20 per day.
   Evaluate the following two queries:
   SQL> SELECT po_id, CASE
   WHEN MONTHS_BETWEEN (shipment_date,po_date)>1 THEN
   TO_CHAR((shipment_date - po_date) * 20) ELSE 'No Penalty' END PENALTY
   FROM shipments;
   SQL>SELECT po_id, DECODE
   (MONTHS_BETWEEN (po_date,shipment_date)>1,
   TO_CHAR((shipment_date - po_date) * 20), 'No Penalty') PENALTY   
   FROM shipments;
   Which statement is true regarding the above commands?
   A. Both execute successfully and give correct results.
   B. Only the first query executes successfully but gives a wrong result.
   C. Only the first query executes successfully and gives the  correct result.
   D. Only the second query executes successfully but gives a wrong result.
   E. Only the second query executes successfully and gives the correct result.

7. Which two  statements are true regarding the USING and ON clauses in table 
   joins? (Choose two.)
   A. Both USING and ON clauses can be used for equijoins and nonequijoins. 
   B. A maximum of one pair of columns can be joined between two tables using the ON clause. 
   C. The ON clause can be used to join tables on columns that have different
      names but compatible data types.
   D. The  WHERE clause can be used to apply additional conditions in SELECT statements 
      containing the ON or the  USING clause.

8. View the Exhibit and examine the structure of the CUSTOMERS table.
   Which two tasks would require subqueries or joins to be executed in a single
   statement? (Choose two.) 

   A. listing of customers who do not have a credit limit and were born before
      1980

      'Sydney'
   D. listing of those customers whose credit limit is the same as the credit 
      limit of customers residing in the city 'Tokyo'
   E. finding the number of customers, in each city, whose credit limit is more
      than the average credit limit of all the customers
