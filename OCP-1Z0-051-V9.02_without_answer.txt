1. View the Exhibit and examine the structure of the SALES, CUSTOMERS, PRODUCTS,
   and TIMES tables.
   The PROD_ID column is the foreign key in the SALES table, which references 
   the PRODUCTS table. Similarly, the CUST_ID and TIME_ID columns are also 
   foreign keys in the SALES table referencing the CUSTOMERS and TIMES tables, 
   respectively.
   Evaluate the following CREATE TABLE command:
   CREATE TABLE new_sales(prod_id, cust_id, order_date DEFAULT SYSDATE)
   AS
   SELECT prod_id, cust_id, time_id
   FROM sales;
   Which statement is true regarding the above command?    
                                                                      
   A. The NEW_SALES table would not get created because the DEFAULT value cannot 
      be specified in the column definition.
   B. The NEW_SALES table would get created and all the NOT NULL constraints 
      defined on the specified columns would be passed to the new table. 
   C. The NEW_SALES table would not get created because the column names in the 
      CREATE TABLE command and the SELECT clause do not match. 
   D. The NEW_SALES table would get created and all the FOREIGN KEY constraints 
      defined on the specified columns would be passed to the new table.

2. View the Exhibit to examine the description for the SALES table.

      GROUP BY prod_id, cust_id   
      WITH CHECK OPTION;

    All products have a list price. 
    You issue the following command to display the total price of each product
	after a discount of 25% and atax of 15% are  applied on it. Freight charges
	of $100 have to be applied to all the products.
    SQL> SELECT prod_name, prod_list_price -(prod_list_price*(25/100))                 
    +(prod_list_price -(prod_list_price*(25/100))*(15/100))+100                                 
    AS "TOTAL PRICE" 
    FROM products; 
    What would be the outcome if all the parentheses are removed from the above

12. You need to produce a report where each customer's credit limit has been 
    incremented by $1000. In the output, the customer's last name should have
	the heading Name and the incremented credit limit should be labeled New 
	Credit Limit. The column headings should have only the first letter of each
	word in uppercase . 
    Which statement would accomplish this requirement? 
    A. SELECT cust_last_name Name, cust_credit_limit + 1000 "New Credit Limit" 
       FROM customers;

13. View the Exhibit and examine the structure of the PRODUCTS table.
    You need to generate a report in the following format:

    D. SELECT prod_name  q'<'s >' 'category is ' prod_category CATEGORIES
       FROM products;

14. Using the CUSTOMERS table, you need to generate a report that shows 50% of
    each credit amount in each income level. The report should NOT show any 
	repeated credit amounts in each income level.  
    Which  query would give the required result? 
    A.
    SELECT  cust_income_level, DISTINCT cust_credit_limit * 0.50    
    AS "50% Credit Limit" 
    FROM customers;
    B.
    SELECT DISTINCT cust_income_level, DISTINCT cust_credit_limit * 0.50    
    AS "50% Credit Limit" 
    FROM customers;
    C.
    SELECT DISTINCT cust_income_level   '   '  cust_credit_limit * 0.50 
    AS "50% Credit Limit" 
    FROM customers;
    D.
    SELECT cust_income_level ' ' cust_credit_limit * 0.50 AS "50% Credit Limit" 
    FROM customers;

15. View the Exhibit and examine the data in the CUSTOMERS table.  
    Evaluate the following query: 
    SQL> SELECT cust_name AS "NAME", cust_credit_limit/2 AS MIDPOINT,
	     MIDPOINT+100 AS "MAX LOWER LIMIT" 
    FROM customers; 
    The above query produces an error on execution. 
    What is the reason for the error? 
    A. An alias cannot be used in an expression. 
    B. The a lias NAME should not be enclosed with in double quotation marks. 
    C. The MIDPOINT+100 expression  gives an error because  CUST_CREDIT_LIMIT 
	   contains NULL values. 
    D. The a lias MIDPOINT should be enclosed with in double quotation marks 
	   for the CUST_CREDIT_LIMIT/2 expression .
